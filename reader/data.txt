A simple paragraph is a group of sentences that focuses on a single idea. It typically begins with a topic sentence that introduces the main point, followed by supporting sentences that expand on the topic. These supporting sentences provide details, examples, or explanations to develop the idea further. The paragraph ends with a concluding sentence that summarizes the main point or provides a closing thought. A well-structured paragraph is clear, concise, and easy to understand, making it an essential building block of good writing.
